HTML entities are special codes used to represent characters that have a special meaning in HTML itself, or characters that are difficult to type on a standard keyboard. They ensure that the characters are displayed correctly in a web browser.

Here are five commonly used HTML entities:

&amp; (ampersand): This is used to represent the actual ampersand symbol (&) since it's also used to introduce other HTML entities.
&lt; (less than): This is used to display the less than symbol (<) because it's used to define HTML start tags.
&gt; (greater than): This is used to display the greater than symbol (>) because it's used to define HTML end tags.
&nbsp; (non-breaking space): This is used to insert a space that won't break onto a new line, even if there's not enough space on the current line. This is useful for things like measurements (e.g., 10 km/h) or preventing unwanted line breaks.
&copy; (copyright symbol): This is used to display the copyright symbol(©).
&quot; (double quote): This is used to represent a double quotation mark (") since it's also a reserved character in HTML for attributes.
&apos; (apostrophe): This is used to display an apostrophe (') because it can also be confused with the single quote used for attribute values.
&reg; (registered trademark): This is used to display the registered trademark symbol (®).
&euro; (euro): This is used to display the euro symbol (€).
&iexcl; (inverted exclamation mark): This is used to display an inverted exclamation mark ¡, which is sometimes used in Spanish.
