            <h2>Semantic Structure</h2>
            <p>HTML5 introduced a new set of semantic elements that describe the meaning and purpose of a content section, rather than just its appearance. This makes websites more accessible for users with disabilities and improves search engine optimization (SEO).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>`header`:** Defines the top section of a webpage, often containing a logo and navigation.</li>
                <li><strong>`nav`:** Represents the navigation section of a webpage, like menus and links.</li>
                <li><strong>`main`:** Defines the main content area of a webpage.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Multimedia Made Easy</h2>
            <p>HTML5 eliminates the need for external plugins like Flash for multimedia playback. It provides native media elements like `audio` and `video` with built-in controls, allowing for direct embedding of audio and video content.</p>
            <p>Here's an example of an embedded video:</p>
            <video width="400" controls>
                <source src="your_video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Offline Functionality</h2>
            <p>HTML5 introduced features like Local Storage and Application Cache, allowing web applications to store data locally on the user's device. This enables limited functionality even when the user is offline, providing a more seamless user experience.</p>
