Here are three key ways to improve the accessibility of your HTML:

1) Semantic HTML: Use HTML elements that describe their meaning and function, not just their appearance. For example, use <h1> for main headings, <h2> for subheadings, and <p> for paragraphs. This helps screen readers and assistive technologies understand the structure of your content.

2) Alternative Text (Alt Text): Provide descriptive alt text for all images using the alt attribute. This text conveys the meaning of the image to users who can't see it, such as those using screen readers.

3) Keyboard Navigation: Ensure your website can be fully navigated using just the keyboard. This is crucial for users who rely on assistive technologies or have difficulty using a mouse. Focusable elements like links and buttons should be clearly defined and accessible using the keyboard tab key.

4) Color Contrast:  Use sufficient color contrast between text and its background to ensure readability for people with visual impairments. There are online tools and web developer extensions that can help you check your color contrast ratios and ensure they meet accessibility guidelines.

5) Clear and Simple Language:  Strive for clear and concise language throughout your website. Avoid overly complex sentence structures, jargon, and technical terms. This benefits users with cognitive disabilities and those who may not be familiar with the specific topic of your website.
